# edsac-emulator

## Building from Source

The Edsac Emulator requires the SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries to build. If the sources aren't included in your distro's package manager, you can donwload the source directly from https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php and https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ and follow the installation instructions found at http://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation.

To cross-compile for Windows, you will need to install the corresponding SDL2 and SDL2_image MinGW libraries found at the same links.
